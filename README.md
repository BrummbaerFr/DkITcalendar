# DkITcalendar


As a user of Google Calendar and studying at Dundalk Institute of Technology in Ireland, I wanted to have my classes on my online calendar.

DkITcalendar is a Firefox extension that converts a DkIT timetable (from https://timetables.dkit.ie/) to an ICS file.

## How to use

Simply click the DkITcalendar button next to your address bar, when on a DkIT timetable page.
You can then save the ICS file and export it to your favourite calendar app.

## Download (Firefox)
